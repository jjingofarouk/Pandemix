# Pandemix - Historical Disease Analysis

Pandemix is a React-based web application designed to explore historical disease data. It fetches information from Wikipedia's API, allowing users to search for diseases, view summaries in a list format, and dive into detailed views of specific diseases. This project is built as part of Option 5: Historical Disease Data Analysis.

## Features
- **Search Functionality**: Use the search bar to find diseases by name.
- **Disease List**: Browse a grid of disease cards with summaries and images (where available).
- **Detailed Views**: Click "Learn More" on a disease card to see detailed historical data.
- **Responsive Design**: Styled with CSS for a clean, user-friendly experience across devices.
- **State Management**: Utilizes React Context API for managing disease data globally.
- **Custom Hooks**: Fetches and manages data efficiently with a custom `useDiseaseData` hook.
